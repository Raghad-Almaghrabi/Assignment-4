# Assignment 3 – Advanced Functionality  
### Portfolio Web Application – Raghad Almaghrabi

This is my third assignment for SWE363 – Web Engineering.  
The goal of this project is to expand my personal portfolio website with **advanced JavaScript functionality**, **external API integration**, **state management**, **performance improvements**, and **AI-assisted development documentation**.

Live Demo (optional): *(Add your GitHub Pages link here if deployed)*

## 🌟 Features Implemented

### ✔ 1. **External API Integration (Weather API)**
- Integrated **Open-Meteo API** to fetch real-time weather for Dhahran.
- Displays temperature, wind speed, weather condition text, and last-updated time.
- Includes a **Refresh Weather** button with graceful error handling.
- Hidden loading states and fallback messages.

### ✔ 2. **Complex Logic**
- Dynamic **project search**, **filter**, **sort**, and **experience-level logic** (Beginner / Advanced / All).
- Automatic **greeting popup** with time-aware messages.
- **Form validation** with inline feedback and error highlighting.
- **Session timer** that tracks how long the visitor has been on the site.
- **Show/Hide Projects** feature with localStorage persistence.

### ✔ 3. **State Management**
- **Dark/Light theme** saved in localStorage.
- **Username greeting** saved in localStorage.
- **Simulated Login System** (Login/Logout toggle stored in localStorage).
- **Project visibility state** (remember if user hid the project grid).
- **Experience level selection** influences filtering logic.

### ✔ 4. **Performance Improvements**
- Cleaned and optimized CSS.
- Removed unused scripts.
- All images moved to `/assets/images/` for easier lazy-loading in the future.
- Minimized DOM reflows during project rendering.
- Cached DOM selectors for improved performance.
- Organized JS into reusable utility functions.

### ✔ 5. **AI Innovation**
AI tools were used for:
- Debugging complex filter logic  
- Improving design consistency  
- Generating documentation structures  
- Code optimization suggestions  
- Creating fallback messages and accessibility improvements
