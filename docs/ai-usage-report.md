### Assignment 3 – Advanced Functionality  
**Author:** Raghad Almaghrabi  
**Course:** SWE363 – Web Engineering  


This document summarizes how AI tools were used during the development of Assignment 3, following the course guidelines for transparency and academic integrity.


---

# 1️⃣ Tools Used
- **ChatGPT (GPT-5.1)** — Code guidance, debugging, documentation.
- **GitHub Copilot** — Inline suggestions inside VS Code.
- **WebStorm / Cursor AI Assist** — Code refactoring hints.

# 2️⃣ How AI Helped (Short Summary)

### ✔ Code Assistance  
AI helped with:
- Structuring `renderProjects()` logic  
- Designing the weather API integration  
- Improving DOM filtering/sorting logic  
- Fixing a bug where projects were hidden due to wrapper visibility  

### ✔ Debugging  
AI detected and helped correct:
- Incorrect element selectors  
- Hidden grid issue  
- Incorrect sorting date comparisons  

### ✔ Documentation  
AI assisted in writing:
- README.md  
- Technical documentation sections  
- This AI usage report

# 3️⃣ What I Modified Manually
- Rewrote all generated code to match my project structure  
- Adjusted logic for filters, experience level, and UI behavior  
- Reworked the show/hide project system  
- Ensured accessibility and localStorage logic was correct  
- Reformatted and optimized the provided snippets  

AI-generated code was never used blindly — every line was reviewed, edited, and integrated manually.

---

# 4️⃣ What I Learned
- How to structure dynamic filtering and sorting systems  
- How to integrate API data safely with loading/error states  
- How to use localStorage effectively for UI persistence  
- How to debug DOM visibility issues  
- How AI can enhance productivity without replacing understanding  

---

# 5️⃣ Ethical Use
- AI was used as a **support tool**, not a code replacement  
- All logic was understood, rewritten, and verified manually  
- No code was copied from classmates or external repos  
- All AI usage is fully documented as required  

---

# ✅ Conclusion
AI accelerated development, improved code quality, and assisted in debugging and documentation.  
All usage was ethical, transparent, and aligned with the learning goals of Assignment 3.
